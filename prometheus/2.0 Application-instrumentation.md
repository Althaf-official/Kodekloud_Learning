### We are building an API for an ecommerce application in Python using the Flask library. Take a look at the /root/main.py file to see the base configuration. There are a total of 4 endpoints.


    GET /products
    POST /products

    GET /cart
    POST /cart



You might see some PLACEHOLDERS in this file which you can ignore for now.

### To instrument this application, we will make use of the prometheus-client python library. Install the same by running the following command on prometheus-server:


    pip install prometheus-client

```ruby
root@prometheus-server ~ via üêç v3.8.10 ‚ûú  ls
main.py

root@prometheus-server ~ via üêç v3.8.10 ‚ûú  cat main.py
from prometheus_client
from flask import Flask

### Update the /root/main.py file to replace the Question 3: PLACEHOLDER section with a Counter metric called http_requests_total. Find more details below:



   (a) First, import the Counter object from the prometheus-client library


from prometheus_client import Counter
   (b) Create a Counter object and name it REQUESTS


         (i) Metric name should be: http_requests_total


         (ii) Description should be: Total number of requests


REQUESTS = Counter('http_requests_total',
                   'Total number of requests')


### Update the /root/main.py file to replace the Question 4: PLACEHOLDER[1-4] sections with the required code blocks.


The http_requests_total metric will track the total number of requests received by the application. This metric should be incremental in all 4 API endpoints defined in /root/main.py. The code that needs to be added is:

    REQUESTS.inc()


Edit /root/main.py file:


vi /root/main.py



Replace each Question 4: PLACEHOLDER[1-4] section with below line:


    REQUESTS.inc()



The updated section of the file will look like as below:


    @app.get("/products")
    def get_products():
        REQUESTS.inc()
        return "product"
    
    
    @app.post("/products")
    def create_product():
        REQUESTS.inc()
        return "created product", 201
    
    
    @app.get("/cart")
    def get_cart():
        REQUESTS.inc()
        return "cart"
    
    
    @app.post("/cart")
    def create_cart():
        REQUESTS.inc()
        return "created cart", 201


### Update the /root/main.py file to replace the Question 5: PLACEHOLDER section with the required code block to expose the metrics on an endpoint using the start_http_server object from the prometheus_client library. Find more details below:



    (a) Import the start_http_server object from the prometheus_client library.


from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server



    (b) Start the http server and make sure it listens on port 8000.


start_http_server(8000)


Edit /root/main.py file:

    
    vi /root/main.py



Update from prometheus_client import Counter line to import start_http_server:


    from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server



Now, replace Question 5: PLACEHOLDER section with below line:


    start_http_server(8000)


### Click on the FlaskApp button to access the Flask app and verify the total number of requests that have been received.

Click on FlaskApp button to access the Flask app and look for http_requests_total, you will find that there are 100 requests received by the app.
![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/d6f734ab-578c-451f-8494-ecd34df5514a)



### Currently, the http_requests_total metric does not provide the capability to track requests per route/endpoint. Add functionality to track the number of requests to each route and each http method using labels. Please find more details below:



     (a) Add two labels path and method to the REQUESTS counter. It should look like as below:


    REQUESTS = Counter('http_requests_total',
                       'Total number of requests', labelnames=['path', 'method'])



     (b) Add .labels() to each REQUESTS.inc() to pass in path and method. For example, REQUESTS.labels('products', 'get').inc() where products are a path and get is a method.


     (c) Run the flask.sh command to restart the app

  ----
  Edit /root/main.py file:


    vi /root/main.py



Update the REQUESTS counter as below:

    
    REQUESTS = Counter('http_requests_total',
                       'Total number of requests', labelnames=['path', 'method'])



Replace each occurrence of REQUESTS.inc() with REQUESTS.labels('products', 'get').inc(), but remember to update the path and method as needed. The updated section in the file will look like as below:


    @app.get("/products")
    def get_products():
        REQUESTS.labels('products', 'get').inc()
        return "product"
    
    
    @app.post("/products")
    def create_product():
        REQUESTS.labels('products', 'post').inc()
        return "created product", 201
    
    
    @app.get("/cart")
    def get_cart():
        REQUESTS.labels('cart', 'get').inc()
        return "cart"
    
    
    @app.post("/cart")
    def create_cart():
        REQUESTS.labels('cart', 'post').inc()
        return "created cart", 201



Run the flask.sh command to restart the app.


    flask.sh



### Configure a new job named api to scrape our Flask application and restart the Prometheus .

Edit the /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file:


vi  /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml



Add below lines under scrape_configs:


  - job_name: "api"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:8000"]



Restart prometheus service:


systemctl restart prometheus

### Go to the Prometheus UI, and in the expression browser, perform the http_requests_total query to find out which specific combination of path and method received the most requests.

Click on Prometheus button to access the Prometheus UI. Enter http_requests_total in the expression browser and click on Execute, you will find that post, products received the most number of requests.

### Update the /root/main.py file to replace the Question 10: PLACEHOLDER[1-2] sections with the code blocks to create a metric to track the number of 404 errors. Use the steps below to complete this task.



   (a) Create a new metric called http_errors_total with the description Total number of errors.

   (b) Add a label called code to this metric.

   (c) Variable name should be ERRORS.


ERRORS = Counter('http_errors_total',
                 'Total number of errors', labelnames=['code'])



   (d) In the function called page_not_found increment, the ERRORS metric and pass in the code label value as 404.


@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(e):
    ERRORS.labels('404').inc()
    return "page not found", 404



     (e) Run the flask.sh command to restart the app.



Edit /root/main.py file:


    vi /root/main.py



Replace the first Question 10: PLACEHOLDER-1 section with below code:


    ERRORS = Counter('http_errors_total',
                     'Total number of errors', labelnames=['code'])



Update Question 10: PLACEHOLDER-2 section under page_not_found function so that the whole function looks like as below:


    @app.errorhandler(404)
    def page_not_found(e):
        ERRORS.labels('404').inc()
        return "page not found", 404



Run the flask.sh command to restart the app.


    flask.sh


### Using Prometheus, find out how many errors the application has received.

Click on Prometheus button to access the Prometheus UI. Enter http_errors_total in the expression browser and click on Execute, you will find that there are 33 errors the application has received.



![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/b45ea8e3-d566-4144-9840-acd2e9fa315d)


### Your would like to add a new metric to track the currently active number of requests being processed by the API. What type of metric should be used for this?


We need a gauge metric because the number of active requests being processed can go up or down with time.



## Update the /root/main.py file to replace the Question 13: PLACEHOLDER[1-3] sections with the code blocks to create a new Gauge metric to track the number of active requests being processed. Find below more details:



(a) Import the Gauge object from prometheus_client library.


from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server, Gauge



(b) Create a new metric called inprogress_requests with a description Total number of requests in progress and store it in a variable called IN_PROGRESS


(c) To calculate the in_progress request count in the app, before every request we‚Äôll increment the metric, then send a response for a request, and finally, we‚Äôll decrement the metric.


(d) Both actions can be done in the before_request and after_request functions.


(e) Call the .inc() method in the before_request function and call the .dec() method in the after_request function.


IN_PROGRESS = Gauge('inprogress_requests',
                    'Total number of requests in progress')

def before_request():
    IN_PROGRESS.inc()

def after_request(response):
    IN_PROGRESS.dec()
    return response



     (f) Run the flask.sh command to restart the app.


----

Edit /root/main.py file:


vi /root/main.py



Update from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server line to import Gauge:


    from prometheus_client import Counter, start_http_server, Gauge



Replace the Question 13: PLACEHOLDER[1-3] sections so that they look like as below:


    IN_PROGRESS = Gauge('inprogress_requests',
                        'Total number of requests in progress')
    
    def before_request():
        IN_PROGRESS.inc()
    
    def after_request(response):
        IN_PROGRESS.dec()
        return response



Run the flask.sh command to restart the app.
