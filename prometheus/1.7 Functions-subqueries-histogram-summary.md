### There are three jobs we added in Prometheus, multimedia, auth, and api. Construct a query that will fetch the node_cpu_seconds_total metric for all jobs and sort it in an ascending order. Save the query in /root/ascending.txt file.

Use the sort function to sort results in ascending order. The final query will be:


sort(node_cpu_seconds_total)

### Construct a query that will return the metric node_memory_Active_bytes for all jobs and sort the results in a descending order
Use the sort_desc function to sort results in a descending order. The final query would be:


    sort_desc(node_memory_Active_bytes)

### Calculate the percentage of free space for all filesystems on all instances under all jobs using below query:


    node_filesystem_avail_bytes*100/node_filesystem_size_bytes


Note how the percentages have a lot of decimal values.


Use the round function to round the query's result to the nearest integer value.

round function will round the results to the nearest integer value. The final query would be:


    round(node_filesystem_avail_bytes*100/node_filesystem_size_bytes)


### In the expression browser, run the following query to get the number of context switches on node01:9100


node_context_switches_total{instance="node01:9100"}


Select the graph button and see the number of context switches over a period of time. Note how the graph shows the active memory rising. This is expected but does not provide useful information as it is a counter, and we expect it to go up. What is more useful to us is to get the rate at which the metric increases.



Construct a query that will show the rate of context switches using a 2m time window

The rate function provides the rate of increase for a counter metric. To calculate the rate, a time window needs to be provided in [] to let prometheus know what window size it should use to average out the rate values across. In this case since the time window is 2m, prometheus will grab the first and last data point in that 2m window and will find the rate of increase between them. Make sure that whatever time window that is selected has at least 4 samples. The final query would be:


    rate(node_context_switches_total{instance="node01:9100"}[2m])



### Management wants to keep track of the rate of bytes received by each instance. Each instance has two interfaces, so the rate of traffic being received on them must be summed up.


Calculate the rate of received node_network_receive_bytes_total using 2-minute window, sum the rates across all interfaces, and group the results by instance. Save the query in /root/traffic.txt.



To calculate rate of received bytes, use the query rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[2m]).


The result needs to be summed up for 2 interfaces on each node as we want to get the combined rates. Use the sum aggregator and aggregate it on the instance label so we can see the total rates per instance. The final query would be:


    sum by(instance) (rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[2m]))



### There were reports of a small outage of an application in the past few minutes, and some alerts pointed to potential high iowait on the cpus. We need to calculate when the iowait rate was the highest over the past 10 minutes.



Construct a subquery that will calculate the rate at which all cpus spent in iowait mode using a 1 minute time window for the rate function. Find the max value of this result over the past 10 minutes using a 30s query step for the subquery.


To get the max value of a range vector, the max_over_time function needs to be used. Since we need to find the max rate at which cpus spend in iowait mode, the rate function returns an instant vector and the max_over_time expects a range vector. In this case a subquery needs to be used. In [] thereâ€™s two subquery values that need to be passed. The first one is how far back should we go to get the rate, the question had asked for 10 minutes. The second value is the query step. The query step tells prometheus how frequently to calculate the rate. So 30s query step means a rate value will be calculated every 30s and passed into the max_over_time function. The final query would be:


    max_over_time(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="iowait"}[1m]) [10m:30s])


### For the http_request_total metric, what is the query/metric name that would be used to get the count of total requests on node node01:3000? Save the query in file /root/http.txt.


Histogram metrics come with a _count metric to give you the total number of observations. The required query would be http_request_total_count{instance="node01:3000"}

### Construct a query to return the total number of requests for the /events route with a latency of less than 0.4s across all nodes. Save the query in file /root/events.txt


![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/0f3178fa-ae1d-4da6-b98f-8ef9bb689edd)


### Construct a query to find out how many requests took somewhere between 0.08s and 0.1s on node node02:3000. Save the query in file /root/requests.txt.



![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/bb45d589-9864-4347-91de-9ee6587908f3)


### Construct a query to calculate the rate of http requests that took less than 0.08s. Use a time window of 1m across all nodes. Save the query in file /root/rate.txt.



![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/065bfaef-ace1-4fb0-9cfd-9525c5537439)



### Construct a query to calculate the average latency of a request over the past 4 minutes. Use the formula below to calculate average latency of request.



    rate of sum-of-all-requests / rate of count-of-all-requests


![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/bbbd3709-12f3-4f56-a965-37e4785a765e)


### Management would like to know what is the 95th percentile for the latency of requests going to node node01:3000. Construct a query to calculate the 95th percentile. Save the query in file /root/quantile.txt.


![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/Kodekloud_Learning/assets/105126131/3c1f6ecc-2ef7-477b-be4c-f1fc392311bb)


### The company is now offering customers an SLO stating that, 95% of all requests will be under 0.15s. What bucket size will need to be added to guarantee that the histogram_quantile function can accurately report whether or not that SLO has been met?


To guarantee that the histogram_quantilereports that we met an SLO, make sure that a bucket at the SLO value exists.


Bucket size which needs to be added to guarantee that the histogram_quantile function can accurately report whether or not that SLO is met is 0.15.



#### A summary metric http_upload_bytes has been added to track the amount of bytes uploaded per request. What are percentiles being reported by this metric?

For Summary metrics, there is a separate time series for each of the desired percentiles which are stored under the label called quantile


Percentiles being reported by http_upload_bytes metric is 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99

### Construct a query to get what is the 90th percentile for uploaded bytes on node node01:3000. Save the query in file /root/percentile.txt.

To get the 90th percentile of the http_upload_bytes metrics for instance node01:3000, add a selector that matches on the quantile="0.9" label. The final query would be:


http_upload_bytes{instance="node01:3000", quantile="0.9"}
