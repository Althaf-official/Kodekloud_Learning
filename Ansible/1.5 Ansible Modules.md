info
In this lab exercise you will use below hosts. Please note down some details about these hosts as given below :



student-node :- This host will act as an Ansible master node where you will create playbooks, inventory, roles etc and you will be running your playbooks from this host itself.


node01 :- This host will act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


node02 :- This host will also act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


Note: Please type exit or logout on the terminal or press CTRL + d to log out from a specific node.

### Which of the following Ansible modules support free_form parameter?

Ansible ```command``` module support ```free_form``` parameter.

### Does Ansible support idempotancy?

Yes, Ansible does support idempotancy.

Idempotency is a key concept in Ansible and other configuration management systems. An operation is considered idempotent if performing it multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. In other words, whether you run an Ansible playbook once or multiple times, the final state of the system should be the same.

In the context of Ansible:

1. **Ensuring Consistent State**: Ansible playbooks are designed to describe the desired state of a system. Each task in a playbook specifies what should be done, and Ansible takes care of making sure the system matches that description. Idempotency ensures that running the playbook multiple times doesn't introduce inconsistencies.

2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Changes**: Ansible achieves idempotency by checking the current state of the system against the desired state before making any changes. If the system is already in the desired state, Ansible won't make any changes. This helps in avoiding unnecessary actions and reduces the risk of unintended consequences.

3. **Safe and Predictable**: Idempotency makes Ansible safe to use because you can run a playbook without worrying about breaking things or causing unintended side effects. It also makes the behavior of playbooks more predictable.

For example, consider a task that installs a package on a server. If the package is already installed, running the playbook again won't reinstall the package. If the package is not installed, Ansible will install it. This behavior ensures that the desired state (presence of the package) is achieved, regardless of the initial state.

```yaml
- name: Ensure a package is installed
  apt:
    name: your_package
    state: present
```

In this example, the `state: present` parameter indicates that the task should ensure the package is installed. Ansible will check whether the package is already installed and only install it if needed.

Idempotency is a fundamental principle in configuration management systems like Ansible, and it plays a crucial role in making infrastructure management more reliable and efficient.

### Which of the following commands we can use to see the information about Ansible modules from command line?


You can use ```ansible-doc``` command to see the information about Ansible modules from command line.

      become_user: root
      tasks:
        - name: create user
          user:
            name: admin


The playbook is using ```user``` module.

### Which of the following statements are true about lineinfile Ansible module?


    
    A. It only adds the given line in file if that line doesn't exist in that file.
    
    
    B. It adds the given line in file even if that line already exists in that file.
    
    
    C. It replaces all existing lines in the file with a new given line.
    
    
    D. It keeps the existing lines as well and add a new given line in the file.

---
      
      The following two statements are true about the lineinfile Ansible module.
      
      
      A. It only adds the given line in file if that line doesn't exist in that file.
      
      
      D. It keeps the existing lines as well and add a new given line in the file.

Absolutely! Let's break down the `lineinfile` module in Ansible in a way that's easy to understand for a 15-year-old.

Imagine you have a big text file, like a diary, and you want to add or change a specific line in that diary. The `lineinfile` module in Ansible is like a magical helper that can help you do that automatically.

Here's a simple analogy:

1. **Your Diary (Text File):** Think of your diary as a big file filled with lots of lines. Each line might be a different entry, just like lines in a configuration file on a computer.

2. **Adding or Changing a Line:** Sometimes, you want to add a new thought or change something in your diary without rewriting the whole thing. The `lineinfile` module helps you do just that with your diary file.

3. **How `lineinfile` Works:** The `lineinfile` module is like a magical pen that can automatically find a specific line in your diary and add or change something on that line.

4. **Example in Ansible:** Let's say you have a file called `my_diary.txt` on your computer, and you want to add the line "Today was a great day!" to it. You can use Ansible with the `lineinfile` module to automatically find the right spot in your diary and add that line.

   Here's what it might look like in Ansible:

   ```yaml
   - name: Add a line to my diary
     lineinfile:
       path: /path/to/my_diary.txt
       line: "Today was a great day!"
   ```

   Ansible will take care of finding the diary file, figuring out where to add the line, and making sure it doesn't add the same line over and over.

So, in simple terms, the `lineinfile` module is like a magical tool in Ansible that helps you add or change specific lines in your files without having to do it all by hand. It's like having a helpful assistant to manage your diary for you!

## Update the playbook /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml to add a new task to create a new user called web_user.

Use the user module for this task. You can find the user details as below.

    Username: web_user
    uid: 1040
    group: developers

Edit the playbook:

    
    vi /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml 



Update the playbook as below:

    
    ---
    - name: 'hosts'
      hosts: all
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: 'Execute a script'
          script: '/tmp/install_script.sh'
        - name: 'Start httpd service'
          service:
            name: 'httpd'
            state: 'started'
        - name: "Update /var/www/html/index.html"
          lineinfile:
            path: /var/www/html/index.html
            line: "Welcome to ansible-beginning course"
            create: true
        - name: 'Create a new user'
          user:
            name: 'web_user'
            uid: 1040
            group: 'developers'
