## You've been tasked with automating the configuration of Juniper devices in your network, to achieve this, you need to install the appropriate Ansible Collection that provides Juniper-specific modules and roles.


Which of the following commands would you use to install the Juniper-specific collection for network automation?

    
    a. ansible-galaxy collection install network.juniper
    
    b. ansible-galaxy retrieve collection network.juniper
    
    c. ansible-galaxy collection get network.juniper
    
    d. ansible-galaxy get collection network.juniper


The following command can be used to install the Juniper-specific collection for network automation.


    ansible-galaxy collection install network.juniper


## You've installed the amazon.aws collection and now you need to create an EC2 instance using a playbook.


Given the following playbook snippet, identify the missing line that correctly imports the amazon.aws collection.


---
- hosts: localhost
  [MISSING LINE HERE]
  tasks:
    - name: Launch an EC2 instance
      ec2_instance:
        name: my-instance
        region: us-west-1




a. collections: [amazon.aws]

b. collection: [amazon.aws]

c. collections=[amazon.aws]

d. collection=[amazon.aws]




```collections: [amazon.aws]``` is the correct way to import the amazon.aws collection.


## You are given access to a lab environment with a machine (i.e student-node) that has Ansible installed. On this machine, there's a /home/bob/playbooks/requirements.yml file that lists several collections required for a project. Your task is to install all the collections listed in the /home/bob/playbooks/requirements.yml file using the correct command.


You can use the following command to install all collections listed in the requirements.yml file.

    
    cd playbooks/
    ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml


```ruby
[bob@student-node ~]$ cat /home/bob/playbooks/requirements.yml
---
collections:
  - name: community.general
    version: '1.0.0'
  - name: amazon.aws
    version: '1.2.1'
[bob@student-node ~]$ ls

```


## You've been informed about a new Ansible Collection named networking_tools under the namespace company_xyz. This collection contains specialized modules for network automation. You need to write a playbook that installs this collection and then uses a custom module named configure_vlan from it to set up VLAN 10 with the name Admin_VLAN.


Complete the playbook located at /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yml to correctly install the networking_tools collection and utilize the configure_vlan module. You just need to fill the placeholders in this playbook.


Please note that, you need not to run this playbook for testing, just make the required changes to fill the placeholders correctly.

Update the playbook /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yml as below:


    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      tasks:
        - name: Install the networking_tools collection
          ansible.builtin.ansible_galaxy_collection:

It looks like there are a couple of issues in your Ansible playbook. Let's go through the errors and fix them:

1. **Incorrect Task Format:** The first error is due to the incorrect format of the task where you are trying to install the `networking_tools` collection. The correct syntax for this task should use the `community.general.collection` Ansible Galaxy module. Replace the task with the correct syntax:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install the networking_tools collection
     community.general.collection:
       name: company_xyz.networking_tools
       source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
   ```

2. **Missing Playbook Argument:** The second error is because you're trying to run the playbook without specifying the playbook file as an argument. When running the `ansible-playbook` command, you need to provide the playbook file as an argument. In your case, use:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i localhost playbook.yml
   ```

   This command assumes that your inventory file (`-i`) is named `localhost` and contains the localhost as a target.

After making these changes, your playbook should work correctly. Here's the corrected playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Install the networking_tools collection
      community.general.collection:
        name: company_xyz.networking_tools
        source: https://galaxy.ansible.com

- hosts: switches
  collections:
    - company_xyz.networking_tools
  tasks:
    - name: Configure VLAN 10
      configure_vlan:
        vlan_id: 10
        vlan_name: Admin_VLAN
```

And run the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i localhost playbook.yml
```

Make sure to replace `localhost` with the appropriate inventory file if needed.


## Given the following sample Ansible playbook /update_web_server_config.yml


    - name: Update web server configuration
      hosts: webservers
      tasks:
        - name: Copy web server configuration file
          copy:
            src: /path/to/webserver.conf
            dest: /etc/webserver/webserver.conf
          notify: Restart web server




Which of the following handler implementations will correctly restart the web server when the configuration file is changed?


    a.
    
    handlers:
      - name: Restart web servers
        service:
          name: webserver
          state: restarted
    
    
    b.
    
    handlers:
      - name: Restart server
        service:
          name: webserver
          state: restarted
    
    
    c.
    
    handlers:
      - name: Restart
        service:
          name: webserver
          state: restarted
    
    
    d.
    
    handlers:
      - name: Restart web server
        service:
          name: webserver
          state: restarted

Following handler implementation will correctly restart the web server when the configuration file is changed.

    
    handlers:
      - name: Restart web server
        service:
          name: webserver
          state: restarted


## You are given access to a lab environment with a server (i.e student-node). On this server, you have a playbook named /home/bob/ansible_lab/handler_test.yml. This playbook contains multiple tasks that notify the same handler. Your task is to run the playbook and answer below question.



How many times will the handler be executed during the playbook run?
    
    
    a) Once for each notifying task.
    
    b) Only once, at the end of the playbook run.
    
    c) Once for each changed task.
    
    d) The handler will not be executed.


Navigate to the ansible_lab directory.


cd /home/bob/ansible_lab



Run the playbook using below command:


ansible-playbook handler_test.yml



Observe the output. Specifically, look for the message Handler has been triggered! to see how many times the handler is executed.


You should see the message Handler has been triggered! only once, even though two tasks notify the same handler. This confirms that a handler is executed only once per playbook run, regardless of how many tasks notify it.
