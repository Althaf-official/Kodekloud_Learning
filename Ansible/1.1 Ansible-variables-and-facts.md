In this lab exercise you will use below hosts. Please note down some details about these hosts as given below :

student-node :- This host will act as an Ansible master node where you will create playbooks, inventory, roles etc and you will be running your playbooks from this host itself.

node01 :- This host will act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:

User: bob
Password: caleston123

node02 :- This host will also act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:

User: bob
Password: caleston123

Note: Please type exit or logout on the terminal or press CTRL + d to log out from a specific node.

### Can we define variables in an Ansible inventory file?


Yes, we can define variables in an Ansible inventory file.

### Can we define variables in an Ansible playbook?

Yes, we can define variables in an Ansible playbook.

### Which of the following formats is used to call a variable in an Ansible playbook?


'{{ variable_name }}' is the correct format to call a variable in an Ansible playbook.

#### The /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml playbook is adding a name server entry in /tmp/resolv.conf sample file on localhost. The name server information is already added to the /home/bob/playbooks/inventory file as a variable called nameserver_ip.


Replace the hardcoded ip address of the name server in this playbook to use the value from the variable defined in the inventory file.



Note: You need not to execute this playbook as of now.



Edit the playbook.

    
    vi /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml



Update the playbook as below.

    
    ---
    - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file on localhost'
      hosts: localhost
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file'
          lineinfile:
            path: /tmp/resolv.conf
            line: 'nameserver {{  nameserver_ip  }}'


```ruby
[bob@student-node playbooks]$ cat /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml
---
- name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file on localhost'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file'
      lineinfile:
        path: /tmp/resolv.conf
        line: 'nameserver 8.8.8.8'
---

  tasks:
    - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file'

        path: /tmp/resolv.conf
        line: 'nameserver {{  nameserver_ip  }}'

      lineinfile:

        line: 'nameserver {{  nameserver_ip  }}'
[bob@student-node playbooks]$ 
```

### We have updated the /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml playbook to add a new task to disable SNMP port on localhost. However, the port is hardcoded in the playbook. Update the playbook to replace the hardcoded value of the SNMP port to use the value from the variable named snmp_port, defined in the inventory file.



Note: You need not to execute this playbook as of now.



Edit the playbook.


    vi /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml



Update the playbook as below.

    
    ---
    - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file on localhost'
      hosts: localhost
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: 'Add nameserver in resolv.conf file'
          lineinfile:
            path: /tmp/resolv.conf
            line: 'nameserver {{  nameserver_ip  }}'
        - name: 'Disable SNMP Port'
          firewalld:
            port: '{{ snmp_port }}'
            permanent: true
            state: disabled

### We have reset the /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml playbook. Its printing some personal information of an employee. We would like to move the car_model, country_name and title values to the respective variables, and these variables should be defined at the play level.


Add three new variables named car_model, country_name and title under the play and move the values over there. Use these variables within the task to remove the hardcoded values.



Edit the playbook.


    vi /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml



Update the playbook as below.

    
    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      vars:
        car_model: 'BMW M3'
        country_name: USA
        title: 'Systems Engineer'
      tasks:
        - command: 'echo "My car is {{ car_model }}"'
        - command: 'echo "I live in the {{ country_name }}"'
        - command: 'echo "I work as a {{ title }}"'



Run the playbook.


    cd /home/bob/playbooks
    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yaml


```ruby
[bob@student-node playbooks]$ cat /home/bob/playbooks/playbook.yaml
---
- hosts: localhost

### The /home/bob/playbooks/app_install.yaml playbook is responsible for installing a list of packages on a remote server(s). The list of packages to be installed is already added to the /home/bob/playbooks/inventory file as a list variable called app_list.



Right now the list of packages to be installed is hardcoded in the playbook. Update the /home/bob/playbooks/app_install.yaml playbook to replace the hardcoded list of packages to use the values from the app_list variable defined in the inventory file. Once updated, please run the playbook once to make sure it works fine.



Edit the playbook.


    vi /home/bob/playbooks/app_install.yaml
