In this lab exercise you will use below hosts. Please note down some details about these hosts as given below :



student-node :- This host will act as an Ansible master node where you will create playbooks, inventory, roles etc and you will be running your playbooks from this host itself.


node01 :- This host will act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


node02 :- This host will also act as an Ansible client/remote host where you will setup/install some stuff using Ansible playbooks. Below are the SSH credentials for this host:


User: bob
Password: caleston123


Note: Please type exit or logout on the terminal or press CTRL + d to log out from a specific node.

## Can loops be executed on dictionary values in Ansible?


Yes, loops can be executed on dictionary values as well.

## Which type of plugin with_* directives use in Ansible?


```with_*``` directives use ```lookup``` plugin.

## The playbook /home/bob/playbooks/fruits.yml currently runs an echo command to print a fruit name. Apply a loop directive (with_items) to the task to print all fruits defined under the fruits variable.


Update the contents of /home/bob/playbooks/fruits.yml playbook as below:


    ---
    -  name: 'Print list of fruits'
       hosts: localhost
       vars:
         fruits:
           - Apple
           - Banana
           - Grapes
           - Orange
       tasks:
         - command: 'echo "{{ item }}"'
           with_items: '{{ fruits }}'



You can test the playbook:


    cd /home/bob/playbooks/
    ansible-playbook -i localhost fruits.yml

```ruby
[bob@student-node ~]$ cat /home/bob/playbooks/fruits.yml
---
-  name: 'Print list of fruits'
   hosts: localhost
   vars:
     fruits:
       - Apple

       - Orange
   tasks:
     - command: 'echo "{{ item }}"'
[bob@student-node ~]$ ansible-playbook -i localhost fruits.yml

## We are attempting to install multiple packages using the yum module for a more realistic use case. The playbook /home/bob/playbooks/packages.yml installs only a single package. Update it to install all packages defined under packages variable.

    ---

[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Invoking "yum" only once while using a loop via squash_actions is 
deprecated. Instead of using a loop to supply multiple items and specifying `name: "{{ item 
}}"`, please use `name: '{{ packages }}'` and remove the loop. This feature will be removed in
 version 2.11. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting deprecation_warnings=False in 
ansible.cfg.
