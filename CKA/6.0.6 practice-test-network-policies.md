In Kubernetes, Ingress and Egress Network Policies are used to control network traffic both coming into and going out of a Kubernetes cluster, respectively.

1. **Ingress NetworkPolicy**:
   - An Ingress NetworkPolicy is used to define rules that govern incoming traffic to services within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - It allows you to control how traffic from external sources (outside the cluster) is routed to your services.
   - With Ingress NetworkPolicy, you can specify which sources are allowed to access specific services, as well as define other rules such as port restrictions, protocol enforcement, etc.
   - Ingress NetworkPolicies are commonly used to enhance security by restricting access to services, implementing routing rules, load balancing, SSL termination, etc.

2. **Egress NetworkPolicy**:
   - Egress NetworkPolicy, on the other hand, is used to control outgoing traffic from the pods within the Kubernetes cluster to external destinations.
   - It allows you to define rules governing which destinations pods are allowed to communicate with outside the cluster.
   - Egress NetworkPolicies are useful for enforcing security measures such as preventing unauthorized access to external resources, blocking specific domains or IP addresses, enforcing protocol restrictions, etc.
   - By using Egress NetworkPolicies, you can ensure that your Kubernetes cluster adheres to your organization's security policies and regulatory requirements.

Both Ingress and Egress Network Policies provide granular control over network traffic within your Kubernetes cluster, helping to enhance security, compliance, and manageability. These policies are defined using Kubernetes YAML manifests and are enforced by network plugins such as Calico, Cilium, or others that support network policy enforcement in Kubernetes clusters.


Alright, let's break it down for a 15-year-old:

Imagine you're in a club (the Kubernetes cluster) where different areas have different rules. You have bouncers at the doors who decide who gets in (Ingress) and who gets out (Egress).

1. **Ingress NetworkPolicy**:
   - It's like rules for who can come into the club.
   - Say, only people with tickets are allowed in. So, the bouncers check if you have a ticket before letting you in.
   - Similarly, in Kubernetes, Ingress NetworkPolicy decides who or what can access the services inside the club (Kubernetes cluster). It might say only certain IP addresses or certain types of requests are allowed in.

2. **Egress NetworkPolicy**:
   - This is like rules for who can leave the club.
   - Let's say there's a rule that nobody leaves after midnight. The bouncers enforce this by not letting anyone out after that time.
   - In Kubernetes, Egress NetworkPolicy decides which services inside the club (Kubernetes cluster) can talk to the outside world and which places they can talk to. It might say that only certain websites or servers can be contacted from inside the cluster.

So, Ingress decides who can come into the club (cluster), and Egress decides where people inside the club (cluster) can go outside and talk to. Both are important for managing and securing the club's (cluster's) activities.



### How many network policies do you see in the environment?

We have deployed few web applications, services and network policies. Inspect the environment.

Run the command:

    kubectl get networkpolicy 
    
or 

    kubectl get netpol

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get networkpolicies.networking.k8s.io 
NAME             POD-SELECTOR   AGE
payroll-policy   name=payroll   77s

controlplane ~ ➜  k describe netpol payroll-policy 
Name:         payroll-policy
Namespace:    default
Created on:   2024-02-25 03:33:05 +0000 UTC

    To Port: 8080/TCP
    From:
      PodSelector: name=internal
  Not affecting egress traffic
  Policy Types: Ingress

controlplane ~ ➜  

```

### What is the name of the Network Policy?

Use the command ```kubectl get netpol``` and identify the name of available network policy.

Network policy is namespace-scoped so list in the ```default``` namespace.


    payroll-policy


```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get networkpolicies.networking.k8s.io 
NAME             POD-SELECTOR   AGE
payroll-policy   name=payroll   77s

controlplane ~ ➜  k describe netpol payroll-policy

  Policy Types: Ingress

controlplane ~ ➜  

```

### Which pod is the Network Policy applied on?

Run the command: ```kubectl get networkpolicy``` and look under the ```Pod Selector``` column.

After getting the labels, identify the correct pod name by their labels.

Run the command: 

    kubectl get po --show-labels | grep name=payroll


```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get po --show-labels | grep name=payroll
payroll    1/1     Running   0          7m40s   name=payroll

### Create a network policy to allow traffic from the Internal application only to the ```payroll-service``` and  ```db-service```.


Use the spec given below. You might want to enable ingress traffic to the pod to test your rules in the UI.

Also, ensure that you allow egress traffic to DNS ports TCP and UDP (port 53) to enable DNS resolution from the internal pod.




    Policy Name: internal-policy
    
    Policy Type: Egress
    
    Egress Allow: payroll
    
    Payroll Port: 8080
    
    Egress Allow: mysql
    
    MySQL Port: 3306

Solution manifest file for a network policy ```internal-policy``` as follows:


    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: internal-policy
      namespace: default
    spec:

        matchLabels:
          name: internal
      policyTypes:

      - Ingress
      ingress:
        - {}
      egress:

            matchLabels:

      - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: payroll
        ports:

          port: 8080
    
      - ports:
        - port: 53
          protocol: UDP
        - port: 53
          protocol: TCP
    

Note: We have also allowed Egress traffic to ```TCP``` and ```UDP``` port. This has been added to ensure that the internal DNS resolution works from the internal pod.



Remember: The ```kube-dns``` service is exposed on port ```53```:
